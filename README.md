GNSS derived Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) analysis tools.
This repository is used mainly to extract and analyze the PWV that is derived from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) radio signals received at ground stations.
Three major works have come to fruition from using this repository:
1)
>Flash floods prediction using precipitable water vapor derived from tropospheric path delays over the Eastern Mediterranean - to be published soon"

This code was used to derive the PWV for GNSS ground station in the Eastern Mediteranean and is referenced in the following work:
>Ziv, S. Z., Yair, Y., Alpert, P., Uzan, L., & Reuveni, Y. (2021). The diurnal variability of precipitable water vapor derived from GPS tropospheric path delays over the Eastern Mediterranean. Atmospheric Research, 249, 105307.

The code is free for use under the MIT license and if it helps you in an academic publication, i'd be happy if you cite the aforementioned work in your paper.
